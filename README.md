# From-Text-to-KongmingLLM
I've been working on a project to create "kongmingLLM," a large language model with the persona of Zhuge Liang. To do this, I've been extracting his dialogue from the text of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" via an API. However, the resulting dataset is too small to effectively fine-tune a sophisticated model.
